What do you tell people about your field of study at a party?<br />
I am a computer science student who spends their entire day looking at random algorithms and trying to make sense of them<br />

I tell people that I'm studying data science, which is all about using computers to help us make better decisions by analyzing information. You know how when you search for something on Google, it gives you a list of results? That's because of data science - the computer is using lots of data to figure out what you're looking for and give you the best options. Data science can also help companies figure out what products people are interested in buying, or help doctors predict which patients are at risk for certain diseases. It's all about using data to make smarter choices
